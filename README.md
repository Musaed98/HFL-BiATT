# HFL-BiATT: Privacy-Preserving Fraud Detection Based on Hierarchical Federated Learning and BiLSTM-Attention

This is the official implementation of the proposed **HFL-BiATT** framework in the paper  
**"HFL-BiATT: Privacy-Preserving Fraud Detection Based on Hierarchical Federated Learning and Bidirectional LSTM with Attention Mechanisms"**.


The model was trained and tested on two widely used fraud datasets: **Credit Card Fraud (ULB)** and **AI4Risk AntiFraud**.

If you want to use the original datasets, please refer to the links below:

2. AI4Risk AntiFraud: https://github.com/AI4Risk/antifraud/tree/main/data
